# COSC 210 Budgeting & Expense Tracking Application

This repository contains my 2026W2 COSC 210-101 Software Construction term project.
I'm going to be developing a simple budgeting and expense tracking application.

## Team

Per Professor Gema Rodriguez-Perez's instructions, I will be working alone on this project.

Author: Lua MacDougall

## Requirements

Per the assignment, this project has the following requirements:
* Must be written in Java
* Must be a desktop application
* After phase 1, the application will have a console-based interface
* After phase 2, the application will be able to save and restore it's entire state
* After phase 3, the application will have a graphical user interface
* Must have a well-defined and sensical data model with non-trivial classes and methods
* Must utilize some kind of collection with an arbitrary number of elements
* Must have complex control flow (loops, branches, nested structures, etc.)
* Must provide solutions to the user stories

Additionally, the application must not be some simple clone of a project that has been provided to me or some commonly known game. I will aim to develop a unique and innovative application that meets the requirements and provides a valuable solution to the user.

## Project

The application will be a simple budgeting and expense tracking application. It will allow users to track expenses and view their spending habits. The application will be able to save and restore its entire state, and will *(eventually)* have a graphical user interface.

It will have the following basic functions:
* Create an expense with a date, category, amount, and description *(e.g. "Feb 10th - Grocery - $100 at the Save-On")*
* Edit an expense's fields *(e.g. change the category or amount)*
* Delete an expense
* View the list of expenses
* View a summary of expenses by category *(e.g. grocery, entertainment, etc.)*
* View a summary of expenses by date range *(e.g. the last month)*
* Calculate the total expenses for a given date range
* Calculate the total expenses for a given category and date range

I will target a specific audience: students. I will focus on creating a user-friendly interface and intuitive features that cater to the needs of students who are managing their finances and are stretched by the cost of living, like myself!

This project is of interest to me as it would be nice to have a simple desktop application that can help me manage my expenses and stay within my budget, instead of relying on confusing Google Sheets spreadsheets that are difficult to use and prone to errors.
